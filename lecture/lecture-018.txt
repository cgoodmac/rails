SENDING EMAILS

AWS SES

aws-ses gem install
add ses_config.rb to initializers folder
add this code to the file:

ActionMailer::Base.add_delivery_method :ses, AWS::SES::Base, :access_key_id => ENV['AWSKEY'], :secret_access_key => ENV['AWSSEC']

add this line to line 17 of config/environments/development.rb

config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :ses

if you want to send email in production environment add that line to production env too

when you push to heroku it auto switches to production environment

In terminal:
rails g mailer (not a great mailer) - shows options

rails g mailer Notifications welcome logoff

creates a mailer folder in the app and views/notifications/ text files

you can send html emails by changing text files to html

Add this line where you want the action to happen in the controller

Notifications.welcome(@pirate.name).deliver

FULL TEXT SEARCH

pg does it by default

Use javascript key logger

$(function(){

  $('body').keypress(pressed_key); //creates a keypress function

});

function pressed_key(key) 
{
  // ctrl-f
  if(key.keyCode == 6)
  {
    console.log('you pressed ctrl-f');

  }

  //ctrl-h
    if(key.keyCode == 8)
  {
    console.log('you pressed ctrl-h');

  }
}
