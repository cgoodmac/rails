RECURSION

FOR EACH ITEM IN MEMORY, EACH BOX ON THE STACK, IT REMEMBERS WHAT LINE YOU WERE ON

You have to be conscious of the stack frame. What are the vars in each stack, what line are you on in each stack?

BIG O NOTATION ****** INTERVIEW QUESTION ******

Hash = constant time (each seach takes 1 step no matter how many items)
Tree = O(log n) - depends on amount of items in tree. 1000 items, log of 1000
Array = y=mx+b (linear), more items, more time it MAY take to find something

BIG O = on the order of (linear, asymptotic, logarithmic, exponential)

Bubble sort O(n^2) => exponential order of time. Have four items, could take 16 steps!
